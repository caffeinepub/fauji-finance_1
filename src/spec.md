# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refresh the Home page to look more modern and finance-oriented with a higher-contrast army-green palette, safer responsive layout, lightweight animations, and new content sections including savings/profit examples and credibility content, plus non-identifiable AI “brand ambassador” photo sections.

**Planned changes:**
- Update Home page visual theme to increase contrast, apply a cohesive finance/army-green palette across backgrounds/cards/typography/buttons, and standardize spacing.
- Audit and fix responsive layout collisions/overlaps across common breakpoints (hero overlays, section transitions, card grids).
- Add subtle, modern finance-style animations (section transitions and hover micro-interactions) with full prefers-reduced-motion support.
- Add new Home page sections: a profit/savings examples section (3+ cards with figures) and at least one credibility-oriented section (testimonials/FAQs/stats).
- Add AI-generated, non-identifiable “celebrity-style” brand ambassador images as static assets and integrate them into Home page sections with graceful image loading fallback.
- Update the Home page content source(s) so new sections are driven from centralized content modules rather than duplicated/hardcoded.

**User-visible outcome:** The Home page appears richer and more professional with a darker, higher-contrast finance/army-green look, no overlapping content on common screen sizes, subtle modern animations, added savings/profit and credibility sections, and new non-identifiable ambassador-style photo content.
