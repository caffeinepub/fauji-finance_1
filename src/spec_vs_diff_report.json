  "summary": "Diff adds new Home page sections (profit examples, customer stats/testimonials, ambassador imagery), expands the color/animation system, and updates carousel/reveal behaviors with reduced-motion handling. However, it appears to violate the “English-only for new UI copy” acceptance criterion and does not provide evidence of the specifically required AI-generated ambassador image assets being added under frontend/public/assets/generated.",
